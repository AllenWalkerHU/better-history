Better History for Chrome
=================

Chrome is an excellent browser, but browsing your history kinda stinks.

Getting rolling
----------------

Better History is crazy easy to get developing on.

1. Just clone this repo
2. Run a `bower install` (for dependencies)
3. Install the repo's directory as an extension

Any changes you make to your cloned repo will be seen immediately in the installed extension. Though sometimes changing translation files (in _locales/) requires a manual extension refresh in Chrome's extension settings.
